📊 Employee Attrition Analysis (HR Analytics Project)

This project analyzes employee attrition to help organizations understand why employees leave, identify critical retention drivers, and build predictive models using machine learning.
It also includes a Power BI HR Dashboard with KPIs and interactive insights.

🚀 Project Overview

Employee attrition is a major challenge for HR teams. This project uses HR data to:

Analyze employee demographics and job-related factors

Identify key drivers of attrition

Build a predictive model to classify employees as “likely to leave”

Create a professional Power BI dashboard for HR teams

The entire project is built using Google Colab (Python) + Power BI.
